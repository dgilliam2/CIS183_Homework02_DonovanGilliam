This is an Android application that allows you to move three sliders corresponding to RGB values. 
The valid RGB values are from 0 to 255. 
As you move the sliders, the background color will change in real time.
The RGB values as well as the hexadecimal representation of those values will also change in real time.
If the color is considered "too dark", the text on screen will change to be white.
You can click the "save colors" button to save the currently selected color.
You can also click on the saved color in the list to apply the color to the background.
